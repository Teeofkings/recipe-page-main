## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS


### What I learned

Today, I applied what i have learn in the past on how to make web layouts fully responsive by converting pixels to vw and also learnt to use flexbox and box-sizing for full-width divs, and targeting specific elements with pseudo-classes like :last-child. I also learned to style list markers and apply popular breakpoints so designs look good on all devices. Overall, I now know how to make content adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes.


### Continued development

Focus on advanced flex/grid layouts, fluid typography and spacing, and responsive design patterns to make your pages scale beautifully on all devices.
